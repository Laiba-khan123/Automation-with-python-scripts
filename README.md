# JPG File Mover (Task Automation with Python)

This project is a simple Python automation script that moves all `.jpg` files from one folder (source) to another (destination). It demonstrates the use of Python's **os** and **shutil** libraries for file handling.

## Features
- Moves all `.jpg` files automatically  
- Creates the destination folder if it doesnâ€™t exist  
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
- Lightweight (no external dependencies)  

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above  

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jpg-mover.git
   cd jpg-mover

2. Open `move_jpgs.py` and update the paths:

   ```python
   source_folder = "C:/Users/YourName/Downloads"
   destination_folder = "C:/Users/YourName/Pictures/JPG_Files"
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python move_jpgs.py
   ```

## Example Output

```
Moved: photo1.jpg
Moved: image2.jpg
Moved: screenshot3.jpg
All JPG files have been moved successfully!
```
